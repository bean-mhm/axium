# axium

**axium** (stylized as lowercase) is a single-header C++ math library providing
utility classes and functions for:
- Generic math functions
- Matrices
- Vectors (2D, 3D, 4D)
- Quaternions
- Polar and spherical coordinates
- 3D rays
- Basic shapes and their intersections:
  - Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)
  - Circles
  - Spheres
- 2D and 3D linear transformations
- Smart number to string conversion

axium is originally based on [gsx](https://github.com/bean-mhm/gsx) (my somewhat
outdated library for games and simulations) and its math module, albeit with
a different naming and coding style.
